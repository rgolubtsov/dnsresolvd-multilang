## Building

This daemon implementation is known to be built and run successfully on ~~OpenBSD, Ubuntu Server, and~~ Arch Linux operating systems. So let's describe each build process sequentially.

### Building under Arch Linux 32 (kernel 4.20.2-arch1-1.0-ARCH i686)

**TODO:** Describe the daemon's dependencies' build/install process under Arch Linux / Arch Linux 32.

**TODO:** Describe the daemon's dependencies' build/install process under OpenBSD and Ubuntu Server.

## Running

To start up the daemon just specify a TCP port that should be used to listen on for incoming connections.
