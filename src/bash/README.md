## Building

This daemon implementation is known to be built and run successfully on OpenBSD, Ubuntu Server, and Arch Linux operating systems. So let's describe each build process sequentially.

### Building under OpenBSD/amd64 6.5

Install the necessary dependencies (): **TODO**

Now the daemon might be built. &ndash; **TODO**

Once this is done, check it out... just for fun:)) &ndash; **TODO**

### Building under Ubuntu Server (Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS x86-64)

Install the necessary dependencies (): **TODO**

Now the daemon might be built. &ndash; **TODO**

Once this is done, check it out... just for fun:)) &ndash; **TODO**

### Building under Arch Linux (kernel 5.2.2-arch1-1-ARCH x86-64)

Install the necessary dependencies (): **TODO**

Now the daemon might be built. &ndash; **TODO**

Once this is done, check it out... just for fun:)) &ndash; **TODO**

## Running

To start up the daemon just specify a TCP port that should be used to listen on for incoming connections.

OpenBSD/amd64 | Ubuntu Server LTS x86-64 | Arch Linux: **TODO**

Example of making **GET** and **POST** requests: **TODO**
